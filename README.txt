i have implement five supervied learning algorithms. They are for:

Decision trees with some form of pruning
Neural networks
Boosting
Support Vector Machines
k-nearest neighbors

The file yourgtaccount-analysis.pdf contain:

  

a description of my classification problems, and why I feel that they are interesting. 

the training and testing error rates you obtained running the various learning algorithms on my problems. At the very least I include graphs that show performance on both training and test data as a function of training size (note that this implies that I design a classification problem that has more than a trivial amount of data) and--for the algorithms that are iterative--training times/iterations. Both of these kinds of graphs are referred to as learning curves
 

analyses of my results.
